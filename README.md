### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial Course: Build a Blog with Craft CMS
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authorskezz-bracey/)

Many content management systems are designed to cater for a specific kind of site and hence are locked into having certain features that can’t be adjusted. 

Craft CMS on the other hand is not oriented towards any one type of site. Rather, it’s designed to be so flexible you can turn it into virtually any kind of site you need.

In our two previous courses [Up and Running with Craft CMS](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/up-and-running-with-craft-cms) and [Building Landing Pages with Craft CMS](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/building-landing-pages-with-craft-cms) we created a solid foundation on the essentials of working with Craft.

In this course you’ll build on that foundation as you learn how to turn Craft CMS into one of the most widely used types of site: a blog. We’ll step through how to setup all the most common features you’re used to from popular blogging platforms.

So let’s go ahead and start “Build a Blog with Craft CMS”!
